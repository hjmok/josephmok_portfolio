        "description1a":"For the model input, two sequence sizes were test. The first sequence size was 66. This is due to quarterly earnings reports being once every 3 months, which encompasses roughly 66 financial days. The second sequence size experimented on was 261, which is the number of financial days in a year. In addition, the RNN will predict 1 day into the future for every 66 or 261 weekdays before it.",
        "description1b":"The model has 4 pairs of LSTM and Dropout layers. Each LSTM layer contains 50 neurons, with a dropout rate of 40% to reduce overfitting. After the 4th LSTM layer, a fully connected layer outputs the final predicted value 1 day into the future. The loss metric used is Mean Squared Error, since this is a regression problem. The Adam optimizer was used for this model. For more details, please look at my code on Github:",
