In addition, the RNN will predict 1 month into the future for every 12 months before it.",

The fully connected layer outputs the final predicted value 1 month into the future. The loss metric used is Mean Squared Error, since this is a continuous value problem. The Adam optimizer was used for this model. For more details, please look at my code on Github:",
