    "description":"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of K-Means Clustering on a mostly unlabelled dataset. This unsupervised learning method can lead to clusters that may indicate survival or death when infected with certain respiratory diseases (COVID19, SARS, ARDS, Streptococcus)",

However, majority of the survival column was unlabeled (256 rows), so K-means was used to perform unsupervised learning on the dataset. After removing the other remaining null values and the survival column, the final dataset was 185 rows by 7 columns as seen below.",
